Use make run to start the program. The user is then prompted to enter an integer greater than 2, this integer will dictate the amount of rings on the starting rod. The program will continue to output the prompt until a valid input is given. Then the program will output the starting rod and the end rod. The program will then output the ring number aswell as where the ring currently is and where it is being moved to. It will continue to do this until all rings are at the end rod without violating any of the restrictions outlined in the assignment.
